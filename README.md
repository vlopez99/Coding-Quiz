This challenge was based off of an online quiz having to do with current coding questions in relations to what we have learned.

The quiz consists of 5 questions with 4 answers each (one of which being correct).

The quiz is on a timer that counts down and loses time when a question is answered wrong.

Once the quiz is over, the user has the ability to record their initals to show off their scores against others.
